## 🚀 About Me
I am an embedded systems engineer and computer engineering student at UC Santa Barbara. I also work in backend development & APIs, Unreal Engine game development, and some databases. In the future, I wish to delve further into the solid-state electronics behind embedded systems and computers and conduct research in the field.
